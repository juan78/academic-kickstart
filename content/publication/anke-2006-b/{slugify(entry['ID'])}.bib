 abstract = {In this paper, we describe concepts for a middleware that enables communication between smart items networks and business applications. Sma rt items networks consist of RFID systems, wireless sensor networks, and embedded systems. The integration of such devices into business applicati ons is challenging, since each device type has its own protocols and programming interfaces. Existing middleware simplifies development of software which runs on smart items but not integration with back-e nd systems. We propose middleware concepts that abstract from the smart items network on a service- oriented level to ease integration into business applications. Our middleware allows the development of business applications which are able to deploy, run and query services from the network without any knowledge of the underlying smart items network.},
