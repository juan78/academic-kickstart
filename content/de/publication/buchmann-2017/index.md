abstract = "Workflow design patterns provide abstract, „best-practices“ solutions to recurring problems. While the majority of workflow patterns focus on control flow, resources and data, our concern are patterns from a data privacy perspective. Privacy patterns have the potential to ease the life of process developers, auditors and privacy officers by providing pre-validated patterns that correspond with existing data privacy regulations. With this paper, we strive to establish workflow privacy patterns as a direction of research. For this purpose, we motivate privacy patterns, we discuss requirements and research directions, and we review options to integrate patterns into existing modeling languages and tools."
