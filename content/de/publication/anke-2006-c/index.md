abstract = "Smart Items are physical objects that are equipped with embedded computing units to enable close coupling of the real world to backend information systems. Such embedded computing units are called PEIDs (product embedded information devices). PEIDs can be RFID tags, sensor nodes, embedded PCs or similar devices. In this paper, we show how PEIDs can be used to support business decisions in the area of PLM (product lifecycle management) and discuss issues that arise from the restricted capabilities of devices and the large amounts of data to be handled. As current middleware systems are too inflexible to address these issues, we propose a new architecture based on mobile services. It effectively reduces the amounts of data to be transmitted by data processing close to the data source. Furthermore, it offers flexibility regarding to new data analysis requirements and heterogenous device capabilities."
