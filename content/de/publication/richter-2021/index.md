abstract = "Exploiting digital technologies for innovative service offerings as part of the digital transformation has been under discussion for several years. As recent research has shown, practitioners struggle with the systematic design of digital services. Along with the progress in the understanding of digital service systems, academia has proposed various processes and methods which are contributing to a methodology for Service Systems Engineering. However, such methods are rarely applied in practice. In our study, we utilize Action Design Research to evaluate how existing methods can be applied in a project that aims to design a service for predictive costing. Our findings are formalized as a combination of methods and their links. It shows how these methods can be employed to guide the innovation process. Although the generalizability of the results is limited through the single case study approach, the proposed combination of methods provides evidence-based knowledge on Service Systems Engineering, which is relevant for practitioners and researchers alike."
